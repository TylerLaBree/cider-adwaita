# Cider Themes: Adwaita and Flatwaita
Two adwaita-style themes for [Cider](https://cider.sh/).

- Adwaita: inspired by the Gnome desktop environment.
- Flatwaita: my spin on Adwaita, mixing in warm elements of [Ros√© Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com) and [Gruvbox Material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material).
