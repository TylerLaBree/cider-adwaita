# Cider Themes: Adwaita and Flatwaita
Two adwaita-style themes for [Cider](https://cider.sh/).

- Adwaita: inspired by the Gnome desktop environment.
- Flatwaita: my spin on Adwaita, mixing in warm elements of [Rosé Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com) and [Gruvbox Material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material).

Also: a Gnome Circle–style icon for your .desktop files!

If you've nevere modified a desktop file on gnome, you can easily manage them with [PinApp](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.fabrialberio.pinapp).
